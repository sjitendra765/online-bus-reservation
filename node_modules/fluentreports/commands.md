# fluentReports Commands

## Report Configuration and Setup Commands


### Report
#### new Report(Destination, Options)

##### Parameters
* Destination - can be one of the following:
  - A File Name - Where to Save it (Any name other than "buffer")
  - Literal string "buffer" - meaning it is buffered into a buffer Object to your "render" callback (see render command)
  - pipe - any valid pipe that can be written too.
  - Parent report - making this a child report of the parent report.

* Options - Default is in (parentheses)
  * landscape: true or (false); to make the report landscaped.
  * paper: (letter), legal, A0-A10, B0-B10, C0-C10, Executive, Folio, Tabloid, RA0-RA4, SRA0-SRA4
  * font: (Helvetica), Courier, Times-Roman, Symbol, ZapfDingbats or a external font file that you provide and add to the report via the "registerFont" command.
  * fontSize: (12), any number from 1-128.
  * margins: (72), can be a single number for all four sides; or a object array like: {left:72, top:72, bottom:72, right: 72}
  * autoPrint: true or (false); to make the report automatically bring up the print dialog
  * fullScreen: true or (false); to make the report automatically full screen when it loads
  * negativeParentheses: true or (false); to make negative number show up like (20) rather than -20.
  * info - object; you can set some of the pdf info

<br><br>

#### Report.x
##### Constants:
* show.
  * once - Show the header/footer only once
  * newPageOnly - Show on all new pages if this reportGroup is the current reportGroup
  * always - show on all new pages even if this reportGroup is a parent of the current reportGroup

* alignment.
  * LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT

* renderType.
  * file - render to a file
  * pipe - render to a pipe
  * buffer - render to a buffer

* trace: true or (false) - output tracing statements to the console
* callbackDebugging: true or (false) - output callback tracing statements; trace needs to be true to use this option; and of course these two affect ALL reports.

Please note; this actually returns the a ReportGroup object; not the Report object -- this is by design since creating a new Report creates the entire structure as such:
- Primary Report Object -> ReportSection -> ReportDataSet -> ReportGroup and so all methods are as such off of the ReportGroup object. 
 
##### Example:
var MyReportObject = new Report("MyCoolReport.pdf", {autoPrint: true});
Would create the report called "MyCoolReport.pdf" and auto print it when it is opened in a pdf reader.

<br><br><br>

### The functions below are methods on the above created and returned ReportGroup object...

<br><br><br>

#### .userData( Data )
##### Description
This allows you to set userData on the report that you might want at some later point in the report -- this is rarely used.
##### Parameters
* Data - whatever extra user data you need access to in the report

<br><br><br>

#### .totalFormatter( function(data, callback(err, data) {}) {} ) 
##### Description
This allows you to set a formatting function to deal with any total values and formatting
##### Parameters
* function - this is a function that will format your totals before it print them.  The function prototype needs to be: function(dataIn, callback(err, formattedDataOut))

<br><br><br>

#### .data ( Data ) 
##### Description
THIS IS MANDANTORY - you need to set a data object otherwise there is no point to the report.

##### Parameters
* Data - this can be an array of arrays; and array of objects, an object, a string/number value or one of the two more advanced data class:
  * a simple query function; the report system calls this function with (currentData, callback) and the prototype callback(err, data) -- when this function is called you can either call the callback with the data OR return ALL the needed data directly from this function. 
  * pageable class; your class needs to implement a "count", "loadRange" methods as a minimum; and optionally can have a "query" method.   
  ** count is called with a callback(err, data) where data needs to be the count of record that are too be printed.
  ** loadRange is called (start, end, callback), start = first record needed, end = last record needed, callback is (err, resultData) 
  ** query is called with (currentData, callback) where callback only has (err) as it just needs to be called when the query is done being prepared.
    
##### Example:
MyReportObject.data([{id: 1, name: 'Nathanael'}, {id: 2, name: 'Anderson'}]);

<br><br><br>


#### .recordCount(recordCountCallback(count, continueCallback))
##### Description
This allows you to be notified of the query result count before the printing actually happens.  This is useful where you can't know the report data count before the report starts, because you are passing in a object that does all the queries itself.  The report when it queries the data count, will call your *RecordCountCallback* function, this function will receive a record count, and a callback function.  You MUST call the continueCallback function.  You can optionally pass the continueCallback a boolean "false" to actually cancel the report, any other value (and no value) is considered that you want to continue printing.
In the event you choose to cancel the report no report will be is generated; and the final render callback done will be passed "false" instead of a filename or buffer.
##### Parameters
* recordCountCallback function
##### continueCallback
* dummy (the callback does not use the dummy; but to keep the same normal type of node callback (err, value))
* continueReport - boolean false = cancel report; any other value (and no value) will continue the report.

##### Example:

function rcCount(count, continueCallback) {
  if (count === 0) { console.log("No records");  callback(null, false); }
  else if (count > 250) { console.log("Too many records") callback(null, false); }
  else callback();
}
MyReportObject.recordCount(rcCount);

<br><br><br>

#### .keys ( keys )
##### Description
This is so you can set a key or keys that get passed to sub-report data query functions/class objects.
##### Parameters
* Keys - A single string key, or array of string keys, this is used to know which data to send to the "query" functions that you can pass into the .data function above -- this is used for sub-reports. 

##### Example:
MyReportObject.keys("id");

<br><br><br>

#### .addReport( Report, options )
##### Description
This is used to add a sub-report; however you can use the easier method of "new Report(parentReport)" rather this "parentReport.addReport(x)" 
##### Parameters
* Report - the Report object you created
* options
  * isSibling - true or (false) -- this allows you to make this report a "sibling" report rather than the normal child report.

<br><br><br>

#### .info ( info )
##### Description
This allows you to set the pdf information and can be passed in as one of the Report(..., OPTIONS)
##### Parameters
* info - this is the object that contains the pdf header information you might want to change or add to the report

<br><br><br>

#### .detail ( detailOutput )
##### Description
This is used so that the report system know how to output each detail record.  This is used in most reports; but in some you might not need it.
##### Parameters
* detailOutput - this can be a array, a string or a function
* array = [[Data Key, Data Width, Data Alignment],[...],...]   Key is the key of the data to use for output, width is how wide to make this, alignment is right, (left), or center.
* string = "some text {{key_1}} more text {{key_2}}...." - where key_1 & key_2 are the index names of the data to use.
* function = This is prototyped  (ReportRenderer, Data, State, Done_Callback) for Asynchronous and (ReportRenderer, Data, State) for synchronous reporting.  The whole report must be either Sync or Async.
  * The ReportRenderer has multiple methods for outputting to your report.   Please see the ReportRenderer section for its methods.
  * The Data is the current line/row of data; you will deal with a SINGLE row of data each time this function is called.
  * The State is the state of the engine; it is a object with multiple keys -- please see the "State" of the engine section for the values in this.
  * Done_Callback - Again, this is only on ASYNC reports; it is Done_Callback(err).
##### Examples
MyReportObject.detail([["name", 120], ["address", 200], ["state", 20]]);
or
MyReportObject.detail("{{name}} lives in the state of {{state}}");
